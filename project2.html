              <p>
                For this project, I had to work in team with Lo√Øc Tuplink and Antoine Sprumont. 
                We were in a Lego industry and we had to sort some kind of brick by criteria.
                Our group had to sort the bricks by their shape.
              </p>
                <p>
                  For that project, We had to use  some embedded systems, raspberry pi, and sensors. 
                  I also did a 3D model for the button to put them in the Din rail.
                  The Lego bricks were put on a conveyor belt to move the to our system.
                  The sensors used were an artificial intelligence camera and an infrared sensor.
                  The camera was used to recognise the shape of the brick and the infrared sensor was used to detect when we had to send the information to the raspberry pi.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The raspberry pi was used to send the information to the database and to the web page, to do that we have a docker with a nodered who helped us to send the information to the database.
                  After that the web site retrieveds data from the database to display it on the web page.
                  The website was coded with nodejs and the database was an mysql.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We had a two recurrent problems : 
                  the first one was the camera: it was not working well, at some moment because it was detecting the wrong shape of the brick.
                  The second one was the conveyor belt with our embedded system. The conveyor belt was interfered with the embedded system, so we had to put the ground of the embedded system to the metal frame of the conveyor belt.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the end of the project, we had to make a presentation of our project and we had to show how it was working.
                  It was working well, and all the objectives were reached.
                  Through the project we have learned to combine all our knowledge to carry out this project.
